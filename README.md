### Deep Learning Grid Search
#### The objective behind this project is that i am trying to learn how to use the scikit-learn grid search capability.

***I am trying to learn the following topics:***

* How to use Keras models in scikit-learn.
* How to use grid search in scikit-learn.
* How to tune batch size and training epochs.
* How to tune learning rate
* How to tune network weight initialization.
* How to tune activation functions.
* How to tune dropout regularization.
* How to tune the number of neurons in the hidden layer.
